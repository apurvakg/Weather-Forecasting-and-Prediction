# Final Year Project

## Title: Weather Forecasting and Prediction

This is my Final Year Project on Weather Forecasting and prediction. I have built this on Artificial Neural Network with Back Propagation.

### Software Used:

- Python Notebook

### Libraries:

- keras
- geopy
- urllib
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## API:

- NASA Power LARC API to fetch the weather data.

## Neural Network:

- We have made 4 layer neural network. 1 input, 2 hidden and 1 output layer.
- The input layer has 6 neurons representing the 6 weather attributes.
- The 2 hidden layers have 8 neurons each.
- The output layer has 6 neurons as the 6 attributes.

## How to run:

- Download the code, You need nothing else.
- Make sure you have active network, for the NASA Power LARC API to fetch weather data.
- Open the main.py in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Enter the starting date, ending date and location.
- You will get the accuracy of the model.
- You can also type the previous day parameters to get 24 Hour predicted value.
